Frequent Itemsets Analysis - Supermarket Data
Project Overview
This project demonstrates frequent itemset mining using the Apriori algorithm on simulated supermarket transaction data. The analysis identifies patterns in customer purchasing behavior by finding frequently co-occurring items in shopping baskets.

Key Features
1.Data Generation: Creates realistic supermarket transactions with 30 different products across multiple categories

2.Apriori Algorithm: Implements frequent itemset mining with minimum support threshold

3.Advanced Analysis: Identifies both closed and maximal frequent itemsets

4.Comprehensive Output: Generates multiple CSV files with analysis results

Technical Implementation
1.Language: Python 3

2.Libraries: pandas, numpy, mlxtend

3.Algorithm: Apriori for frequent itemset mining

4.Data: 3,000 simulated transactions with 2-7 items per transaction

Files Generated
1.supermarket_transactions.csv: Raw transaction data

2.frequent_itemsets.csv: All frequent itemsets meeting support threshold

3.closed_itemsets.csv: Closed frequent itemsets

4.maximal_itemsets.csv: Maximal frequent itemsets

Results Summary
30 frequent itemsets identified with support between 13.7% and 15.7%

Most popular items: Cheese, Apple, Tea, Potato, and Chicken

Validation: All maximal itemsets confirmed as closed, ensuring result integrity

Skills Demonstrated
1.Data preprocessing and one-hot encoding

2.Association rule mining concepts

3.Implementation of Apriori algorithm

4.Identification of closed and maximal itemsets

5.Data analysis and result validation

This project showcases practical application of market basket analysis techniques commonly used in retail and e-commerce for product recommendation systems and store layout optimization.
